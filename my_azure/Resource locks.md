As an admin, you may need to lock a [[Subscription]], [[Resource Group]], or a [[Resource]] to prevent other users from accidentally modifying or deleting critical resources.

**lock levels**
- **CanNotDelete (Delete)**: authorized users can still read and modify a [[Resource]], but they can't delete it.
- **ReadOnly (Read-Only)**: authorized users can read a [[Resource]], but they can't update or delete it.
