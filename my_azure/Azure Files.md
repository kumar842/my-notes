# Azure Files

Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments

# When to use
- You want to "lift and shift" an application to the cloud that already uses the native file system APIs to share data between it and other applications running in Azure.
- You want to replace or supplement on-premises file servers or NAS devices.  
- You want to store development and debugging tools that need to be accessed from many virtual machines.
