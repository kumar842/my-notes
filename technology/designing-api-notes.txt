1. Plan your APIs
 1.1. List out the user FUNCTIONALITY of your API
    Identify the resources & their interactions.

    Users    : add user, edit user, delete user, get user, get users etc.
    Messages : send a message, draft a message, send a draft, edit a draft, delete a draft, mark as read, mark as unread, move messages to folders etc.
    Products : View product, review product, add product to cart, add to whishlist
    Cart     : view cart, add a product, change quantity, delete quantity, checkout etc.


 1.2. Think LONG TERM… like 2-3 years down the road -- versioning

2. Spec Driven Development (Part 2)
 2.1. Define Your API in a Flexible, but Standard Spec
    - RAML provides a quick, powerful, semantic, yet human readable format for describing your API.  The API Designer makes it simple to get started and even shows you what your API looks like as you describe it.

 2.2. Mock Your API and get User Feedback
 2.3. Code to the Spec… and Don’t Deviate

3. Nouns, CRUD, and More
 3.1. Use Nouns as Resources
    /createuser
    /edituser/id/1
    /deleteuser/id/1

    /users
    /users/id/1
    /messages

 3.2. Use JSON (when possible)
 3.3. Use the Content-Type Header

4. Hypermedia
 4.1.
